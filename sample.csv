National Security Agency,30+ days ago,"Desired: Machine LearningNSA Overview

The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.

At NSA, mathematics and statistics are core disciplines and are present in every aspect of the mission.

Mathematical Statisticians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, regression, machine learning, exploratory data analysis, stochastic processes, and statistical modeling and forecasting. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and cybersecurity (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information).

Mathematical Statisticians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.

Description of Position

To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.

The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Statistics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, statisticians work in:

Signals analysisData compressionMachine learningData scienceHuman language technologySpeech/image/video processingAnalysis of communication networksNetwork vulnerability analysisCybersecurity
Additionally, computing is an essential component of the mathematical sciences at NSA and statisticians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematical statistician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.

Based on core competencies in microfluidics, molecular biology, and engineering, ANDE is delivering field forward systems that provide dramatically superior capabilities than currently possible.Far more accurate than a fingerprint, DNA is the gold standard for identification. But the value of DNA is diminished by the excessive time required for evidence processing in labs that are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of samples. With few exceptions, laboratory DNA analysis requires weeks, months or – in some jurisdictions – years. This leads to sample backlogs and increases the time required to solve crimes and disrupt terrorist activities. Millions of samples are not submitted or even collected because the results come too late to have a real impact.ANDE is addressing these major problems. We have developed a Rapid DNA Analysis system that accepts samples and generates DNA IDs in under two hours.

TripAdvisor,30+ days ago,"Desired: TensorFlowLinuxHiveMachine LearningHadoopKafkaPerlSQLBig DataJavaSparkShell ScriptingPythonTripAdvisor, the world’s largest travel site, operates at scale with over 500 million reviews, opinions, photos, and videos reaching over 390 million unique visitors each month. We are a data driven company, and we have lots and lots of data! The Data Warehouse team is responsible for building and managing the infrastructure and tools that enables the rest of the company to interact with the petabytes of data in our data lake.
Our mission statement is to create a new world class analytics infrastructure for TripAdvisor. We just finished a massive project to create a new ETL platform based on Kafka and Samza providing a less than 7-minute latency between activity on the site to our data warehouse. Internal adoption of this platform has drastically changed how front-end teams track and analyze site activity and our current forecasts is for this to handle tens of terabytes of data a day in the near future.

Our next epoch will focus on building better tools and infrastructure for analyzing and making use of this data. This is largely a green-field effort and we are looking for individuals who can help us design and build this new analytics infrastructure largely from the ground up.
This is a hands-on job for a “big data” engineer. The job requires both serious technical chops and effective communication skills. You will provide technical leadership in an environment that moves fast, collaborates between teams and team members, and that expects you to own your projects.

The Data Warehouse team works closely with our Analytics team to manage all stages of the data pipeline. We make use of technologies like Spark, Hive, Presto, and Amazon Redshift in our ETL pipelines which expose the data to our analyst and machine learning applications. Some members of our team even do a bit of UI work for the series of internal tools we have built and maintained; these include tools that automatically detect data anomalies, enable analysts and engineers to easily build/manage their own ETLs, or even managing the many A/B tests that TripAdvisor runs on a regular basis. Lastly, we use some of the latest machine learning libraries in our tools and analysis, including TensorFlow.

In addition to building the software that is the backbone of how TripAdvisor processes data, the warehouse team has operational responsibilities for ensuring our infrastructure is meeting the agreed upon SLAs.

We are looking for someone with a strong sense of responsibility: taking pride in your work, leveraging others, owning the problem. And you love, and we mean love, data.

Qualifications
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent
5+ years of large scale, full life cycle development experience
In-depth technical experience with big data technologies such as Hadoop (HDFS, Hive, Map/Reduce), Spark, Kafka/Samza
General software engineering and programming experience; most of our larger projects are in Java, but we also have lots of scripts in Python, Bash, even some Perl.
ETL and SQL expertise
Linux experience
Ops / DevOps experience is a plus

Boston University,30+ days ago,"Topic: Water utility modeling that analyzes revenue stability and incorporates capital investments, focused on identifying utility business models that encourage sustainable water use while also being fiscally sustainable for the utility

Start Date: Immediately

Duration: Full-time, one-year position, with extension planned

Background

Water scarcity coupled with increasing population growth, increasing water demand, and declining infrastructure systems pose a threat to both the people of Texas and the vital freshwater inflow needed to feed sensitive bays and estuaries along the Gulf Coast. In order to increase water use efficiency in urban areas and enhance conservation of limited freshwater resources, many stakeholders are now considering fundamental changes in water management, including transitioning to integrated urban water management (IUWM) approaches such as ‘One Water.’

Boston University’s Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is engaged in a multi-year project funded by the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation with the goal of assessing how siloed municipal water agencies in the state of Texas can transition to an IUWM model in order to increase water use efficiency in urban environments, revitalize aging infrastructure, and preserve freshwater inflow to the major bays and estuaries along the Texas Gulf Coast. ISE’s work is focused on integrated water utility financial modeling, and the model results will be used to establish recommendations of viable pathways to move to IUWM in Texas.

About the Institute for Sustainable Energy

The Boston University Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is a university-wide center dedicated to facilitating the transition to a sustainable, climate-safe global energy system. Through interdisciplinary research, policy analysis, and collaborative engagement, our mission is to ensure that the energy systems of the world provide abundant, sustainable, and universally accessible energy services to both emerging and advanced economies. This enormous challenge will require new technologies and energy processes, new forms of financing and financial institutions, new policy approaches, and new forms of public governance, and new companies, industries, and markets. Our work spans all of the disciplines, departments, and colleges at BU and involves many partnerships with other researchers, policymakers, and industry. Core work areas comprise defining pathways to becoming the utility of the future in both the electric and water sectors, with a common theme of moving towards a business model based on electricity/water efficiency; emissions reduction in transportation; and city climate modeling.

Duties and Responsibilities

The Research Fellow will lead the development modeling work that builds on existing utility revenue models and incorporates analysis of maintaining revenue stability with capital investments factored in. The expanded model will incorporate key aspects of the One Water framework such as reuse, distributed water treatment and low impact development, and demand projection.

An expanded model will be a toolbox for utilities, providing analysis of different revenue and cost trajectories based on different urban water management strategies – including some that typically fall outside today’s utility framework. This can be a practical tool that supports effective implementation of integrated urban water management.

Specific responsibilities include:

Develop an analytical framework that enables assessment of various water utility business models based on the cost and revenue opportunities associated with holistic management of multiple types of water, including potable, graywater, blackwater, and stormwater.
Guide modeling work that enables quantitative analysis of an appropriate set of case studies representing different scenarios.
Produce, edit, and review technical reports, briefs, and presentations on modeling research.
Build strong relationships with key practitioners and stakeholders in the water industry in Texas and beyond.
Support communications with a National Advisory Committee associated with this project, and with the funder.
Pursue new project opportunities relating to water management and utility of the future.


Required Skills
The ideal applicant will have:

A PhD in a related field (e.g. energy/environmental sciences, energy engineering) is preferred. Candidates with a Masters degree in a related field or an MBA, plus substantial, relevant work experience may also be considered.
Expertise in water utility business models and best practices for infrastructure management.
Demonstrated experience designing, building, and using spreadsheet models for financial analysis.
A strong background in finance-related quantitative methods and data analysis.
Demonstrated project and task management capabilities, including supervising other staff and performing quality assurance on work products.
Strong leadership, management, technical, communications, and interpersonal skills.
Excellent writing and presentation skills (for both technical and non-technical audiences) and a record of presenting research results in academic, policy, or other forums.
Experience developing new client relationships and establishing new projects.

To fix that, we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T""). We provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers from A-to-Z. From acquiring, inspecting and certifying high quality cars, to providing 360° high-resolution photography inside and outside of the vehicle, to generating real-time financing and warranty options, to providing consumers with the option to have cars delivered to their driveway in as little as 24 hours or pick-up from one of our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machines (yes, you read that right) all with a 7-day Money Back Guarantee, we've made it our mission to redefine the car buying status quo. With no dealerships or commissioned salespeople, we also save thousands of dollars per car in expenses that we pass on to our customers.

The Google Cloud team helps companies, schools, and government seamlessly make the switch to Google products and supports them along the way. You swiftly problem-solve technical issues for customers to show how our products can make businesses more productive, collaborative, and innovative. You work closely with a cross-functional team of web developers and systems administrators, not to mention a variety of both regional and international customers. Your relationships with customers are crucial in helping Google grow its Google Cloud business and in bringing our product portfolio into companies around the world.
The Advanced Solutions Lab (ASL) for Machine Learning (ML) provides customers with the opportunity to work side by side with Google’s machine learning experts in an immersive experience that enables companies to tackle their highest impact business challenges. Participants will be trained on machine learning concepts and engineering techniques similar to what we provide our own Google engineering teams. Participants also have the opportunity to work on short projects that are relevant to their industry or business application.
The Advanced Solutions Lab is run out of Google Cloud’s Professional Services Organization (PSO). The mission of PSO is to ensure that our customers and partners get the most out of the Google Cloud offering, whether that be GCP, GSuite, Maps, Chrome or a combination of these products.
As an Machine Learning Solutions Engineer, you will be focused on delivering and, at times creating, cutting-edge ML training to the ASL participants. You will be working side by side with our customers as they try to see how they can apply ML to their businesses. The number of participants at the Advanced Solutions Lab is small and you will be helping them understand how they can apply their learnings from the program to their specific business use cases. You will be the owner of the ‘day to day’ experience of the Advanced Solutions Lab. Therefore you will always be working to see how you can make the offering better, be that by making recommendations to the curriculum team about curriculum enhancements, identifying Google ML experts who should be brought in to support various sessions in the program or making recommendations on pre-packaged ML models or projects that should be added.
Outside of the Advanced Solution Lab experience you will also be part of the wider PSO and Google Cloud ML group of experts and consultants and will also have the opportunity to work on client facing projects to help customers more generally benefit from Google Cloud Machine Learning solutions. Some of these customers may have already attended the Advanced Solutions Lab and will be looking to develop their solutions further; others may just be starting on their ML journey and you will be helping them discover the possibilities of what they can do. These activities may occur at client sites.
Google Cloud helps millions of employees and organizations empower their employees, serve their customers, and build what’s next for their business — all with technology built in the cloud. Our products are engineered for security, reliability and scalability, running the full stack from infrastructure to applications to devices and hardware. And our teams are dedicated to helping our customers — developers, small and large businesses, educational institutions and government agencies — see the benefits of our technology come to life.
Responsibilities
